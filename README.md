## Introduction

GesTemps is a tool that allows you to regulate the automatic temperature as needed and also to detect the most favorable moment to ventilate the room through sensors.
If the temperature exceeds the maximum of what we had mentioned, the LCD screen displays that the temperature is higher then a signal for activating the cooling mechanism is sent and in the event that the temperature is too low a signal for stop is sent to the mechanism.

## How it works

GesTemps unit is placed in the same room as the air conditioner and the radiator. It then connects to the air conditioner and a heater in the same room. We then initialize an ideal temperature interval, we place sensors on the windows and doors of the room (to know how long they are open). When we open the windows to ventilate the room, the positioning sensors will allow us to know exactly when they have been opened and for how long. The box will now be able through integrated temperature sensors and sensors on the windows to regulate the ambient temperature of the room and also to make a detailed report to the user on its aeration time and the ideal moment to ventilate the room.
